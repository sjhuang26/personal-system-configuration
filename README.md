# Personal System Configuration

This is my personal configuration for my computers.

## Key features

- Uses the GNU stow library
- Doom Emacs configuration
  - "Review mode" for incrementally showing lines of a file, useful for active recall learning
- old Spacemacs configuration

## Future ideas

- better Org Roam configuration
- decide on a font to use
- better keybindings
- EXWM, StumpWM, or XMonad support
- syncing of Opera extensions folder
- Android development in Emacs
- LaTeX editing and fast math input
- hotkeys for adding tags to list items
- automatic adding of newlines to the end of files
- undo tree
- consider going back to Spacemacs
